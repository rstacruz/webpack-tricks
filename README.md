# Webpack tricks

Just a small catalog of Webpack tips and tricks I've learned. All of those tips and tricks concern Webpack 1. Webpack 2 has a different API, so some of those tips won't work there. A detailed guide about migrating to v2 [can be found here](http://javascriptplayground.com/blog/2016/10/moving-to-webpack-2/).

Progress reporting
------------------

Invoke Webpack with:

```
--progress --colors
```

Minification
------------

Invoke Webpack with `-p` for production builds. In Webpack 2, this also automatically sets `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'`.

```js
webpack -p
```

Multiple bundles
----------------

Export multiple bundles by setting the output to `[name].js`. This example produces `a.js` and `b.js`.

```js
module.exports = {
  entry: {
    a: './a',
    b: './b'
  },
  output: { filename: '[name].js' }
}
```

Concerned about duplication? Use the [CommonsChunkPlugin](https://webpack.github.io/docs/list-of-plugins.html#commonschunkplugin) to move the common parts into a new output file.

```js
plugins: [ new webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin('init.js') ]
```

```html
<script src='init.js'></script>
<script src='a.js'></script>
```

Split app and vendor code
-------------------------

Use CommonsChunkPlugin to move vendor code into `vendor.js`.

```js
var webpack = require('webpack')

module.exports = {
  entry: {
    app: './app.js'
  },

  output: {
    filename: '[name].js'
  },

  plugins: [
    new webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin({
      name: 'vendor.js',
      minChunks: ({ resource }) => /node_modules/.test(resource)
    })
  ]
}
```

How this works:

- CommonsChunkPlugin will remove all libraries from `app.js` that are inside `node_modules` and bundle them into `vendor.js`
- CommonsChunkPlugin also moves the Webpack runtime into `vendor.js`

Source maps (Webpack 1)
-----------------------

The best source maps option is `cheap-module-eval-source-map`. This shows original source files in Chrome/Firefox dev tools. It's faster than `source-map` and `eval-source-map`.

```js
// Webpack 1 only
const DEBUG = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'

module.exports = {
  debug: DEBUG ? true : false,
  devtool: DEBUG ? 'cheap-module-eval-source-map' : 'hidden-source-map'
}
```

Your files will now show up in Chrome Devtools as `webpack:///foo.js?a93h`. We want this to be cleaner like `webpack:///path/to/foo.js`.

```js
output: {
	devtoolModuleFilenameTemplate: 'webpack:///[absolute-resource-path]'
}
```

> Reference: [devtool documentation](https://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html#devtool)

Source maps (Webpack 2)
-----------------------

The best source maps option is `cheap-module-source-map`. The cheap-module-eval-source-map strategy no longer shows correct traces in Chrome/Firefox.

```js
// Webpack 2 only
const DEBUG = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'

module.exports = {
  devtool: DEBUG ? 'cheap-module-source-map' : 'hidden-source-map'
}
```

If you're using [extract-text-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/extract-text-webpack-plugin), use `'source-map'` instead. CSS sourcemaps won't work otherwise.

```js
// Only if you're using extract-text-webpack-plugin
module.exports = {
  devtool: DEBUG ? 'source-map' : 'hidden-source-map'
}
```

Your files will now show up in Chrome Devtools as `webpack:///foo.js?a93h`. We want this to be cleaner like `webpack:///path/to/foo.js`.

```js
output: {
	devtoolModuleFilenameTemplate: 'webpack:///[absolute-resource-path]'
}
```

> Reference: [devtool documentation](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/#devtool)

Output CSS files
----------------

This is complicated, and the guide [can be found here](recipes/css.md).

Development mode
----------------

Want to have certain options only appear in development mode?

```js
const DEBUG = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'

// Webpack 1
module.exports = {
  debug: DEBUG ? true : false,
  devtool: DEBUG ? 'cheap-module-eval-source-map' : 'hidden-source-map'
}

// Webpack 2
module.exports = {
  devtool: DEBUG ? 'cheap-module-source-map' : 'hidden-source-map'
}
```

__Webpack 1:__ Be sure to invoke Webpack as `env NODE_ENV=production webpack -p` when building your production assets.

__Webpack 2:__ Invoke Webpack as `webpack -p` when building your production assets. `NODE_ENV` is automatically set by Webpack.

Investigating bundle sizes
--------------------------

Want to see what dependencies are the largest? You can use webpack-bundle-size-analyzer.

```js
$ yarn global add webpack-bundle-size-analyzer

$ ./node_modules/.bin/webpack --json | webpack-bundle-size-analyzer
jquery: 260.93 KB (37.1%)
moment: 137.34 KB (19.5%)
parsleyjs: 87.88 KB (12.5%)
bootstrap-sass: 68.07 KB (9.68%)
...
```

If you're generating source maps (you should), you can also use source-map-explorer, which also works outside of Webpack.

```js
$ yarn global add source-map-explorer

$ source-map-explorer bundle.min.js bundle.min.js.map
```

> Reference: [webpack-bundle-size-analyzer](https://github.com/robertknight/webpack-bundle-size-analyzer), [source-map-explorer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/source-map-explorer)

Smaller React
-------------

React will build dev tools by default. You don't need this in production. Use the EnvironmentPlugin to make these dev tools disappear. This saves you around 30kb.

```js
plugins: [
  new webpack.EnvironmentPlugin({
    NODE_ENV: 'development'
  })
]
```

__Webpack 1:__ Be sure to invoke Webpack as `env NODE_ENV=production webpack -p` when building your production assets.

__Webpack 2:__ Invoke Webpack as `webpack -p` when building your production assets. `NODE_ENV` is automatically set by Webpack.

> Reference: [EnvironmentPlugin documentation](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/environment-plugin/)

Smaller Lodash
--------------

[Lodash](https://lodash.com/) is very useful but usually we only need a small part of its full functionality. [lodash-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/lodash/lodash-webpack-plugin) can help you shrink the lodash build by replacing [feature sets](https://github.com/lodash/lodash-webpack-plugin#feature-sets) of modules with [noop](https://lodash.com/docs#noop), [identity](https://lodash.com/docs#identity), or simpler alternatives.

```js
const LodashModuleReplacementPlugin = require('lodash-webpack-plugin');

const config = {
  plugins: [
    new LodashModuleReplacementPlugin({
      path: true,
      flattening: true
    })
  ]
};
```

This may save you >10kb depending on how much you use lodash.

Requiring all files in a folder
-------------------------------

Ever wanted to do this?

```js
require('./behaviors/*')  /* Doesn't work! */
```

Use require.context.

```js
// http://stackoverflow.com/a/30652110/873870
function requireAll (r) { r.keys().forEach(r) }

requireAll(require.context('./behaviors/', true, /\.js$/))
```

> Reference: [require.context](http://webpack.github.io/docs/context.html#require-context)

Clean up extract-text-webpack-plugin log
----------------------------------------

If you're seeing this in your debug log when using [extract-text-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/extract-text-webpack-plugin):

```
Child extract-text-webpack-plugin:
        + 2 hidden modules
Child extract-text-webpack-plugin:
        + 2 hidden modules
Child extract-text-webpack-plugin:
        + 2 hidden modules
```

Turn it off using `stats: { children: false }`.

```js
/* webpack.config.js */
stats: {
  children: false,
},
```
